# GitDemo

Part 2 of SSD's GitTember workshop on branches, merging, and pull requests.

## Part 1 Recap

41.74 + 49.74

To setup your repository start by forking this one (top-right of GitHub) to create your own. Then, you can use the following command to make a local repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/GitDemo
```

To commit changes, use the following three-step process:

```
git add <file>
git commit -m "Message"
git push <repository> <branch>
```

If changes have been made to the remote repository, you can one of the following:

```
git pull <repository> <branch>
```

## Branches

In this segment, you will create a branch to add the missing Git commands below and merge it into the original repository.

To create a branch, use the following command:

```
git ..?
```

Once the branch is ready to merge, switch to the target branch (master) and use the following command:
```
git ..?
```

Finally, find the command to delete the branch (since it's already been merged) and then push everything to the remote repository. You should be able to view all of your changes on GitHub.

## Pull Requests

In this section, you will create a pull request back to the original repository with changes you've added.

To start, create a new feature branch to contain your changes. Add whatever you'd like to the repository (make sure it's unique to help avoid conflicts!) and commit the changes. Next, push the new branch to GitHub.

GitHub should display an option to create a Pull Request from your new branch (if not, you'll have to do so manually from the original repo in the Pull Requests tab). Create a new pull request with the changes from your branch and we'll see what happens!
